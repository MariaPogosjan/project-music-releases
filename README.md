# Music Releases
During this week's project we did a new album and single releases app. We used React components to build it. 

## The problem
When we started this project we started to fetch the data by importing the data to each component. Later we learned how to only import the data in the first compontent only and then use props to send the date to the rest of the compontents. 

We also learned what the use of the "key" is. We had a lot of problem with naming unique key names, but we learned how to naming them correctly and also where we need to add them. 

Tech used:
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- JSX
- API
